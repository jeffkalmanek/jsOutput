	<ol> items to add to the MacOS Automation build

		<li>following the instructions from this link, as the Appium Instructions leave out what I think are iOS Developer installs

		<li>finding that there is an issue with 'applesimutils' in xcode, so skipping this optional install from the medium.com link</li>

	<p>another note is that to start a raw repository in gitHub first with the readme.md and then clone that "empty" repository into sublime to get things started.  No easy path to go the opposite direction, probably could figure it out in terminal but why?  </p>
