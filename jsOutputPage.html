<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My First Paragraph, not sure why the rest won't show up</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<p>Never call document.write after the document has finished loading.  It will overwrite the whole document.  But I am calling it to write "11" and the rest of the document is here</p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 7 + 6;
document.write(5 + 6);
</script>
<p>this is a paragraph afer document.write, looks like it just adds the number in between two paragraphs?</p>
